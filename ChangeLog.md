## 1.8.18 (WIP)
1. Gtk2: Remove mozilla version detection.
2. Gtk2: Remove `QTC_GTK2_OLD_MOZILLA`.
3. Remove `xcb-image` dependency. It is never used.
4. Gtk2: Fix old configure file loading in gtk2 version.
   Thanks to Lars Wendler for noticing this.
5. Qt4: Fix compile without Qt
6. Relicense under LGPL. With permission from all contributors in the git log.
7. Qt: Treat `Qt::Sheet` as `Qt::Dialog`. This fixes translucent background for
   close confirmation dialog in QtDesigner.
8. Remove backward compatible options.
9. Qt5: Introduce `prePolish()` to Workaround a bug in Qt5 which make it
   impossible for QMainWindow and QDialog to be transparent.
   [Qt-Bug](https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-34064)
10. Qt4: Fix compilation without X11 enabled.
11. Qt4: Use `prePolish()` in qt4, this fixes most of application crashes.
12. Qt: Fix Qt menubar background when translucency is enabled.
13. Gtk2: Fix flash plugin in non-chromium/firefox browsers in linux when
    translucent background is enabled for gtk.
14. Qt4: Fix (workaround) kaffeine with translucent background.
15. Remove parentless dialog fix
16. Qt4: Fix kscreenlocker. Second version of prepolishing
17. Qt: Improve shadow of QBalloonTip
18. Draw shadow at runtime. Prepare for more advanced shadow feature and
    configuration.
19. Gtk2: Remove `QTC_GTK2_USE_CAIRO_FOR_ARROWS`. I cannot reproduce any
    problems on my Intel card. This is also necessary for the Gtk3 port. If
    it was really a bug of the Intel driver, it should rather be fixed there.
20. Qt: Remove `QTC_QT4_OLD_NVIDIA_ARROW_FIX` and
    `QTC_QT5_OLD_NVIDIA_ARROW_FIX`. They honestly only make things worse. Again,
    if it was really a bug of the driver, it should rather be fixed there.
21. Reorganize directories.
22. Gtk2: Add `libqtcurve-cairo` for common drawing routines (Shared between
    Gtk2 and Gtk3).
23. Qt4: Re-enable translucent background in KWin.
24. Gtk2: Fix translucent background in inkscape.
25. Gtk2: Enable translucent background in flash plugin.
26. Improve shadow gradient.

    Changing the depth of the window (which require recreating the window)
    breaks the XEmbed protocol.
15. Gtk2: Generate all GdkPixbuf inline csourse at compile time.
16. Qt4: Require 4.6.0
17. Qt4, Qt5: Longer scrollbar in order to be more friendly to applications

10. Fix buttons in chromium's menu - mouse over colour, and text colour when
    using darker colour schemes.
11. Remove `QTC_CAIRO_1_10_HACK` cmake option. For cairo 1.10, an easier fix

    this by default.

## 1.7.1-KDE4
1. Remove kmix 'fix', and ue a proper fix! Dont access `QWidget`s' winId unless
   `w->testAttribute(Qt::WA_WState_Created) && w->internalWinId()` Thanks to
   Thomas Lübking

11. Add warning about opacity settings and compiz.
12. Fix drawing of background images onto titlebar.

## 1.7.1-gtk2

14. Workaround kcmshell terminating immediately after QtCurve config dialog is
    closed - increase `KGlobal` reference count.
15. When shading tab background, use `fillRect()` and not `fillPath()` -
    seems to workaround glithches with intel 2.12 graphics driver.
16. Fix kwin option to only apply opacity to titlebar.
17. Add option to control whether window titlebars are filled with the
    background *before* the titlebar gradient is applied.

8. Add position setting for background image; top left, top middle, top right,
   bottom left, bottom middle, bottom right, left middle, right middle, and
   centred.
9. Use square tooltips by default. (Problems have been reported with Pidgin and
   rounded tooltip - but I cannot reproduce these!)

11. Fix reading of QtCurve supplied default kdeglobals file.
12. Fix rounding of troughs of progressbars within treeview.
13. When using glow focus, dont draw glow focus and line focus on button of
